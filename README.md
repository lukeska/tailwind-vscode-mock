# Visual Studio Code mock with Tailwind CSS

This code re-creates the Visual Studio Code UI with Tailwind CSS and Prism.

This gave me the chance to research an interesting topic such as how to style a third-party library - Prism in this case - with Tailwind.

I also used Tailwind `resolveConfig` function to reference my configuration in Javascript and push a little bit further what can be achieved with Prism.
